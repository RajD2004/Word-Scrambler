# C++ String Utilities

This repository contains two small C++ programs focused on string manipulation.

## Files
- `scrambler.cpp` – Word Scrambler: reverses the inner letters of each word while keeping the first and last letters unchanged :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- `ascii_neighbors.cpp` – ASCII Neighbors: removes characters that are not equal to, one above, or one below the ASCII values of their neighbors :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

## How to Compile & Run
### Word Scrambler
```bash
g++ scrambler.cpp -o scramble
./scramble
```
### Ascii Neighbors
```bash
g++ ascii_neighbors.cpp -o neighbors
./neighbors
```
